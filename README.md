# Covid 19 - Data Engineering project

## Project description:
While Covid 19 has been spreading over the globe for the past two years, it has been challenging for governments to implement policies in order to reduce the number of cases and especially deaths caused by the pandemic. A large amount of data is made publicly available nowadays in order to help and guide them in their policy choices. An important challenge comes from the number of factors taken into account in order to predict accurately the future cases and deaths as well as the aggregation of the data coming from a high number of different sources. This project aims to overcome this challenge by gathering the necessary data from two reliable sources (ECDC and Eurostat) to predict the cases and deaths in Europe on a weekly basis. The reason behind the choice of focusing on European countries only comes from the fact that I am more familiar with the websites sourcing this data.



## Included files: 
Since I integrated GitHub to my Azure Data Factory account, all the files in this repositery are in json format. The only files that are not in this format are located in the **databricks_files** and **schema** folders and have been uploaded for illustrative purposes.

## Important note:
For now the servers are not running since I only have a free-tier Azure account, so if you wish to access and run the entire project on your own machine, please get in touch with me.
